# Contributing to Webmastery Site Toolkit for MCP

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This document covers how to report bugs, request features, and submit code changes.

---

## Ways to contribute

- **Bug reports** — open a GitHub Issue describing what happened, what you expected, and your WordPress/PHP versions
- **Feature requests** — open a GitHub Issue describing the ability you want and why it's useful for AI agents
- **Pull requests** — bug fixes and features from the backlog are welcome; see below for conventions

---

## Development setup

### Prerequisites

- WordPress 6.9+ (local install — [LocalWP](https://localwp.com/) is recommended)
- PHP 8.0+
- Composer for WordPress Coding Standards checks
- The [MCP Adapter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mcp-adapter/) plugin installed and active
- An MCP client for testing (Claude Code or Claude Desktop)

### Setup

1. Clone this repo into your local WordPress plugins directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielBoring/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp.git webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp
   ```
2. Activate the plugin via WP Admin or WP-CLI:
   ```bash
   wp plugin activate webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp
   ```
3. Create a test user with the Editor role and generate an application password (see README.md for details)
4. Point your MCP client at the local site and run the MCP Adapter discovery tool, `mcp-adapter-discover-abilities`, to confirm the abilities load

## Code conventions

This plugin follows [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/) and is evaluated against the [WordPress.org Detailed Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/). Key rules enforced throughout the codebase:

- **Sanitize inputs** — use `sanitize_text_field()` for strings, `absint()` for IDs, `wp_kses_post()` for HTML content, and enum validation for fixed-value fields
- **Capability checks** — every ability must have a `permission_callback` that returns a `WP_Error` on failure, not just `false`; prefer object-specific checks such as `edit_post` / `delete_post` when an object ID is available, and make list/query abilities filter each returned object plus totals before exposing full details
- **Security-sensitive abilities** — include allowed and denied manifest cases for abilities that expose private data, user identity, environment/plugin details, destructive actions, uploads, or status transitions; use `assert_missing_paths` when lower-privilege responses must hide fields
- **Prefer WordPress APIs** — use WordPress API functions (`get_posts()`, `wp_insert_post()`, etc.) for normal reads and writes. Direct `$wpdb` reads are limited to administrator-only diagnostics such as database health checks, must be prepared where variables are present, and must surface query errors.
- **No output buffering** — abilities return arrays or `WP_Error` objects; the MCP Adapter handles serialization
- **WordPress.org readiness** — avoid trademark-confusing names, spammy readme text, undisclosed external calls, bundled duplicate libraries, and non-GPL-compatible assets

Run local QA before opening a PR:

```bash
composer install
composer qa
```

`composer qa` runs the normal fast pre-PR checks: Static QA plus Unit Tests. See [`docs/qa-strategy.md`](docs/qa-strategy.md) for the full QA posture, including when to run Ability Contract QA, Full MCP E2E QA, Release Package QA, and Compatibility QA.

## Adding a new ability

Each group of abilities lives in its own file under `includes/`. Follow the existing pattern:

1. **Create or open** the relevant class file (e.g., `includes/class-media.php`)
2. **Register** the ability inside the class's `register()` method using `wp_register_ability()`
3. **Use the `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/` prefix** for the ability name (e.g., `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-media`)
4. **Require the narrowest relevant capability** in `permission_callback` — use object-specific checks when an input ID is available and never skip the check
5. **Return a consistent shape** — match the affected ability group's existing success arrays and `WP_Error`/structured error responses
6. **Require the class file** in `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp.php` inside the `wp_abilities_api_init` action and call `ClassName::register()`
7. **Add E2E manifest coverage** in `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`; include both allowed and denied roles when permissions differ by role or capability, plus missing-path assertions when sensitive fields should be absent
8. **Update docs and changelogs** when behavior is user-facing: `README.md`, `readme.txt`, relevant markdown files, and `CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`. Changelog entries should use plugin-facing release-note wording rather than raw internal ability namespace strings unless the exact MCP tool name is necessary. Repository, CI, contributor, GitHub platform, template, or agent workflow changes belong in `.github/REPOSITORY_CHANGELOG.md`.

A minimal ability skeleton:

```php
wp_register_ability( 'webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/your-ability', [
    'label'               => 'Label shown in MCP clients',
    'description'         => 'One-sentence description.',
    'category'            => 'webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp',
    'input_schema'        => [
        'type'       => 'object',
        'properties' => [
            'example_id' => [ 'type' => 'integer', 'description' => 'An ID.' ],
        ],
        'required' => [ 'example_id' ],
    ],
    'execute_callback'    => [ self::class, 'execute_your_ability' ],
    'permission_callback' => function ( $input ) {
        if ( ! current_user_can( 'edit_post', absint( $input['example_id'] ?? 0 ) ) ) {
            return new WP_Error( 'forbidden', 'Requires edit_post capability for this object.' );
        }
        return true;
    },
    'meta' => [
        'annotations' => [ 'readonly' => false, 'destructive' => false, 'idempotent' => false ],
        'mcp'         => [ 'public' => true, 'type' => 'tool' ],
    ],
] );
```

Set `annotations` accurately — `readonly: true` for read-only abilities, `destructive: true` for deletes, `idempotent: true` if calling it twice produces the same result.

## Local QA commands

Use the fastest command that covers your change:

Environment-specific notes for GitHub Actions, Windows PowerShell, and Windows Git Bash live in [`docs/qa-strategy.md`](docs/qa-strategy.md#environment-notes).

| Command | What it runs |
| --- | --- |
| `composer qa` | Fast local default: Static QA plus Unit Tests |
| `composer qa:static` | PHP lint, PHPCS, PHPStan, Composer audit, manifest structure validation, security QA validation, and `git diff --check` |
| `composer qa:unit` | PHPUnit unit tests |
| `composer validate:security-qa` | Static security QA policy checks for risky permission callbacks and required permission-hardening manifest cases |
| `composer qa:contract` | Docker Ability Contract QA against an already-running Compose stack |
| `composer qa:e2e` | Docker Full MCP E2E QA against an already-running Compose stack |
| `composer qa:release` | Release Package QA, including Docker contract/transport QA, built package validation, and WordPress Plugin Check |
| `E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:contract` | Ability Contract QA with automatic Compose startup and cleanup |
| `E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:e2e` | Full MCP E2E QA with automatic Compose startup and cleanup |
| `scripts/qa-local.sh --contract` | Unix/Git Bash wrapper for Composer QA plus managed Ability Contract QA |
| `scripts/qa-local.sh --e2e` | Unix/Git Bash wrapper for Composer QA plus managed Full MCP E2E QA |
| `scripts/qa-local.sh --release` | Unix/Git Bash wrapper for Composer QA plus Release Package QA |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Contract` | PowerShell wrapper for Composer QA plus managed Ability Contract QA |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -E2E` | PowerShell wrapper for Composer QA plus managed Full MCP E2E QA |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Release` | PowerShell wrapper for Composer QA plus Release Package QA |
| `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -PreflightOnly` | Windows prerequisite check without installing dependencies or running QA |
| `scripts/qa-local.sh --preflight-only` | Unix/Git Bash prerequisite check without installing dependencies or running QA |

For Windows, install PHP and Composer first, then restart your terminal so both commands are available on `PATH`. A winget-based PHP install is acceptable when it provides PHP 8.0+:

```powershell
winget search PHP --source winget
winget install --id PHP.PHP.8.2 --source winget
php -v
composer --version
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -PreflightOnly
```

If winget installs PHP but `php` is still unavailable, add the package directory that contains `php.exe` to your user `PATH`, then restart the terminal. Composer can be installed globally, or as a user-local wrapper that invokes `composer.phar` with the PHP binary.

If you run the Bash wrapper from WSL, install PHP and Composer inside WSL. Windows `php.exe` and `composer.bat` may appear on WSL's `PATH`, but the Bash wrapper expects Unix `php` and `composer` commands. Use the PowerShell wrapper when validating with Windows-installed PHP and Composer.

If a Windows Composer installation cannot invoke `vendor/bin/phpcs` by name, run the equivalent direct fallback:

```powershell
php vendor\squizlabs\php_codesniffer\bin\phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml.dist
```

The lightweight manifest validator checks JSON structure, expected fields, roles, labels, and assertion shapes. Full ability registration coverage still requires Ability Contract QA because registered abilities are only available inside WordPress after the plugin and MCP Adapter load.

When checking GitHub Actions status from the CLI, include the PR number or branch before `--repo`:

```bash
gh pr checks 67 --repo DanielBoring/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp --watch=false
gh pr checks issue-18-content-hygiene --repo DanielBoring/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp --watch
```

## WordPress.org plugin guideline review

Before packaging a release for WordPress.org, maintainers compare the final plugin against the Detailed Plugin Guidelines. Contributors should also consider these items for public-facing or release-impacting PRs:

- Confirm the display name and slug do not begin with or imply ownership of another project or trademark.
- Keep readme tags to five or fewer, avoid keyword stuffing, and only link to directly relevant resources.
- Document any external service dependency or remote request. This plugin should not track users, load executable code from third-party services, or add public-facing credits.
- Confirm all bundled code, screenshots, and assets are GPL-compatible.
- Use WordPress-bundled libraries instead of shipping duplicate copies.
- Verify the `Version` header, `Stable tag`, changelog, release zip name, and top-level zip directory all describe the same release.

---

## Versioning policy

This project follows **Semantic Versioning** (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **MAJOR** (`X.0.0`) — breaking changes to ability names, required inputs, output shape, or behavior that can break existing MCP clients.
- **MINOR** (`1.X.0`) — new backward-compatible abilities or features.
- **PATCH** (`1.4.X`) — backward-compatible bug fixes, security fixes, and documentation-only corrections.

Release checklist:

1. Choose the version bump based on the rules above.
2. Update the `Version` header in `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp.php`.
3. Move relevant plugin-facing `CHANGELOG.md` entries from `## Unreleased` into the new version section. Do not include `.github/REPOSITORY_CHANGELOG.md` entries in plugin release notes.
4. Update `Stable tag`, plugin changelog entries, and upgrade notice in `readme.txt`.
5. Confirm the generated zip uses the `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp` directory slug.
6. Run the official WordPress Plugin Check utility against the generated `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp` package and confirm there are no unexpected errors.
7. Review the latest scheduled/manual `6 - Compatibility QA` result for upstream WordPress/PHP/plugin dependency drift.
8. Tag and push `vX.Y.Z` to trigger the release workflow.

---

## Release process (maintainers)

1. Update the `Version` header in `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp.php`
2. Move plugin-facing `CHANGELOG.md` notes from `## Unreleased` into the release version
3. Add release notes to `readme.txt` under `== Changelog ==` and `== Upgrade Notice ==`
4. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: release v1.x.x"`
5. Tag and push: `git tag v1.x.x && git push origin v1.x.x`
6. GitHub Actions runs contract, transport, package, and Plugin Check validation, then creates the release automatically
7. Download the zip from the release and verify Plugin Check evaluates it as the `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp` slug
8. Upload the verified package to the WordPress.org SVN

### Plugin Check notes

The official Plugin Check utility must evaluate the built package from an `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp` top-level directory. Running it from a differently named folder can report a text-domain mismatch even when the plugin header and i18n calls correctly use `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp`.

Known warnings that are acceptable for this plugin:

- `WordPress.DB.SlowDBQuery.slow_db_query_meta_query` in SEO overview: the Yoast focus-keyword and meta-description checks are explicit administrator-requested diagnostics, limited to 50 published posts/pages, and return IDs only.
