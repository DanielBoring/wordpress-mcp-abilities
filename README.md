**Webmastery Site Toolkit for MCP** is a WordPress plugin that adds **70+ permission-aware abilities across 16 areas** for AI agents and MCP clients. It works with the official [MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter): the adapter provides the transport layer, and this plugin registers the WordPress abilities an agent can call. It works with popular MCP clients including Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini.

Use it to let an agent draft or update content, manage media and comments, inspect site health, review SEO metadata, audit plugins and users, and gather safe site context without having to login to wp-admin.

For release history, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Who This Is For

- WordPress site owners who want safe AI-assisted content workflows.
- Developers building MCP workflows around WordPress.
- Technical editors and administrators managing content, SEO, and site operations.

## Quickstart

1. Install and activate the [MCP Adapter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mcp-adapter/) plugin.
2. Install **Webmastery Site Toolkit for MCP** from **WP Admin → Plugins → Add New** (search for the plugin name), then activate it.
3. Create a dedicated WordPress user for the agent. Use **Editor** permissions for normal content work.
4. Create an application password for that user.
5. Configure your MCP client with `@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote`.
6. Ask the client to call `mcp-adapter-discover-abilities`.

The complete setup guide, client-specific examples, and full ability tables live on the [project documentation page](https://www.virtuallyboring.com/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/).

## Abilities

Every ability uses WordPress capability checks. An Editor account can handle day-to-day editorial workflows; Administrator-only abilities are intentionally separate because they expose site configuration, installed plugin metadata, or account audit details.

| Area | What the agent can do | Typical role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Posts and pages | Create, list, read, update, restore, trash, bulk publish, bulk trash, and patch targeted content with object/status-aware filtering for private, trash, draft, pending, and scheduled content | Author or Editor |
| Blocks and revisions | Inspect Gutenberg block paths/hashes, replace one block, list revisions, restore a revision | Author or Editor |
| Post meta | Read, update, and delete safe custom fields; write supported Yoast SEO and SEOPress metadata | Author or Editor |
| Custom post types | Discover eligible public CPTs and generate list/get/create/update/delete abilities with CPT capability-map and object/status-aware list filtering | CPT capability map |
| Taxonomy | List, get, create, update, and delete categories and tags | Subscriber to Editor |
| Comments | List, reply, update, approve, hold, trash, or mark spam | Editor |
| Media | List, inspect, update, upload public image URLs, set featured images, and delete media | Author or Editor |
| Content hygiene | Find orphaned media, posts/pages missing featured images, and stuck scheduled posts | Author or Editor |
| Site info | Return safe site basics and current-user context; runtime, WordPress version, database, and theme-version details require Administrator access | Subscriber to Administrator |
| SEO and webmaster signals | Analyze content, inspect and write supported Yoast/SEOPress metadata, read Yoast scores, inspect generated Yoast head data, and check sitemap/webmaster signals | Author to Administrator |
| Plugins, users, health, security, performance, backups, database | Audit or manage sensitive site areas with explicit admin capabilities | Administrator |

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| WordPress | 6.9+ |
| PHP | 8.0+ |
| [MCP Adapter](https://github.com/WordPress/mcp-adapter) | Latest |
| [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) | Optional; enables Yoast metadata, score, generated head, and sitemap diagnostics |
| [SEOPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seopress/) | Optional; enables SEOPress metadata inspection/writes and site overview diagnostics |

Self-hosted WordPress is required. This works on WordPress installs where custom plugins can be added, including most managed hosts. It does not work on WordPress.com Free, Personal, or Premium plans.

## Install

Install the [MCP Adapter](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mcp-adapter/) first. Then install **Webmastery Site Toolkit for MCP** from **WP Admin → Plugins → Add New**: search for the plugin name, click **Install Now**, and **Activate**.

### Manual or development install

To install a release ZIP manually, download the [latest release package](https://github.com/DanielBoring/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/releases/latest) and upload it in **WP Admin → Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.

For local development, clone the repository into your WordPress plugins directory, then activate it from the Plugins screen:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielBoring/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp.git webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp
```

## Connect Your MCP Client

All local stdio clients use the same three environment variables. Set `WP_API_URL` to the full MCP Adapter endpoint for your site.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wordpress": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote@latest"],
      "env": {
        "WP_API_URL": "https://your-site.com/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server",
        "WP_API_USERNAME": "ai-editor",
        "WP_API_PASSWORD": "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Codex uses TOML instead of JSON:

```toml
[mcp_servers.wordpress]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@automattic/mcp-wordpress-remote@latest"]

[mcp_servers.wordpress.env]
WP_API_URL = "https://your-site.com/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server"
WP_API_USERNAME = "ai-editor"
WP_API_PASSWORD = "xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
```

Other clients mostly differ by config file location and root key. See the [full setup guide](https://www.virtuallyboring.com/webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/#connect-your-mcp-client) for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, Copilot CLI, Codex, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, and ChatGPT notes.

## Verify

Ask your MCP client to call `mcp-adapter-discover-abilities`. It should show the MCP Adapter discovery tools plus this plugin's `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` abilities.

Try a few safe checks:

- `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-posts` - "List the 5 most recent published posts."
- `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-site-info` - "Get safe public context for this WordPress site."
- `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/webmaster-verification-status` - "Check public Google and Bing webmaster verification signals."
- `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/plugin-audit` - "Audit installed plugins." Requires an Administrator service account.

If discovery shows fewer abilities than this repo documents, the connected WordPress site is running an older deployed copy of the plugin. Update the site plugin, then run discovery again.

## Security Best Practices

- Use a dedicated service account, not your personal account.
- Use **Editor** for routine content work and a separate **Administrator** account only for sensitive audits or plugin management.
- WordPress capability checks gate every ability.
- List abilities for posts, pages, custom post types, media, and SEO scores filter every returned object before exposing full details; private, trashed, draft, pending, and scheduled content is only returned when WordPress grants the matching object/status capability.
- Creating or updating content as `publish`, `private`, or `future` requires the relevant publish capability, and bulk publishing requires `publish_posts`.
- Author display names remain in content responses, but login names are omitted from post, page, CPT, revision, and content-hygiene responses. User login and email fields are only returned from user lookup abilities when the caller can edit that user.
- Deletes for posts and pages move content to trash; media deletion is permanent.
- Block and partial-content edits can use hash preconditions and fail when a target is missing, ambiguous, or stale.
- Subscriber-safe site info deliberately avoids secrets, filesystem paths, salts, auth keys, raw server internals, WordPress version, and theme version. `get-environment-info` requires `manage_options`.
- `get-environment-info`, `plugin-audit`, `user-access-audit`, `database-health`, `performance-status`, `backup-status`, `security-audit`, and `site-health-check` are Administrator-only.
