# Ability Contract and Full MCP E2E QA

For the full repository QA posture, including static checks, unit tests, release checks, and GitHub Actions trigger policy, see [`docs/qa-strategy.md`](../../docs/qa-strategy.md).

The Docker QA suite has two layers:

1. Ability Contract QA is ability-driven. Every registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability must be represented in `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`.
2. Full MCP E2E QA uses real MCP Adapter HTTP JSON-RPC requests against `/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server` to prove a remote MCP client can create, read, update, and delete content through the adapter transport.

Current coverage is 75 base registered abilities plus 5 generated abilities per eligible custom post type. The E2E runner registers two fixture custom post types, so the manifest covers 85 abilities across 205 test cases, including custom post type discovery and CRUD permission coverage for two capability maps, object/status-aware post, page, CPT, media, and SEO score list filtering, private-status and bulk-publish denial cases, sensitive identity-field absence checks, taxonomy get/update permission coverage, post and page listing response-shape assertions, expanded Yoast and SEOPress metadata write coverage, controlled Google Site Kit status/module/permission/PageSpeed route fixtures with shared-dashboard, denial, privacy, and same-site URL coverage, the bulk post abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/bulk-trash-posts` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/bulk-publish-posts`, the revision abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-revisions` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/restore-revision`, the post meta abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-post-meta`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/update-post-meta`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/delete-post-meta`, the block editing abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-content-blocks`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/patch-content-block`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/patch-post-content` with targeted post, page, CPT, permission-denial, and unsupported-type coverage, the comment interaction abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/reply-comment` and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/update-comment`, the media sideload ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/upload-image`, the content hygiene abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-orphaned-media`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-posts-no-featured-image`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-stuck-scheduled`, the site introspection abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-site-info`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-user-info`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-environment-info`, the user access audit ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/user-access-audit`, the Yoast score and metadata abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-seo-scores`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-readability-scores`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-yoast-metadata`, the SEOPress metadata ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/get-seopress-metadata`, the webmaster verification ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/webmaster-verification-status`, the database health ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/database-health`, the performance status ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/performance-status`, the backup status ability `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/backup-status`, plus the plugin abilities `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/list-plugins`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/plugin-audit`, `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/activate-plugin`, and `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/deactivate-plugin`.

## Rule for new abilities

When a PR adds a new ability, it must also add at least one manifest test case for that ability. If the ability is registered but missing from the manifest, E2E QA fails.

For abilities with role or capability restrictions, include both:

1. A positive case for a role that should be allowed.
2. A negative case for a role that should be denied.

For security-sensitive abilities, also include any assertions needed to prove the response does not leak data. Examples include `assert_missing_paths` for login names, emails, backend versions, protected metadata, private/trash totals, or other fields that lower-privilege users must not see. `composer validate:security-qa` enforces the current high-risk permission-hardening cases that protect against regressions like the WordPress.org review findings fixed in PR #90.

## What CI checks

`scripts/e2e-test.sh contract` runs `tests/e2e/ability-runner.php`, which:

1. Creates deterministic WordPress fixtures.
2. Installs and activates the MCP Adapter, Yoast SEO, and SEOPress plugin dependencies.
3. Reads `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`.
4. Gets the currently registered abilities from `wp_get_abilities()`.
5. Fails if any registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability is missing from the manifest.
6. Fails if the manifest references an ability that is not registered.
7. Executes every manifest case through `wp_get_ability()->execute()`.
8. Supports positive assertions, negative assertions, missing-path assertions for sensitive fields, post meta assertions, and post thumbnail assertions.
9. Writes `e2e-artifacts/e2e-summary.json` with coverage and result counts.

`scripts/e2e-test.sh e2e` runs `tests/e2e/mcp-crud-runner.php`, which:

1. Creates temporary Application Password credentials for the existing E2E editor and subscriber users.
2. Initializes real MCP HTTP sessions against the MCP Adapter default server.
3. Verifies `tools/list` exposes the `mcp-adapter-execute-ability` gateway.
4. Discovers this plugin's post CRUD abilities through `mcp-adapter-discover-abilities`.
5. Calls `mcp-adapter-execute-ability` over HTTP JSON-RPC to create, read, update, and trash a real draft post.
6. Confirms a subscriber write attempt is denied through the MCP transport.
7. Writes `e2e-artifacts/mcp-crud-summary.json` with protocol-level CRUD result counts.

## Local QA entry points

For quick local checks that do not require WordPress, run:

```bash
composer validate:e2e-manifest
composer validate:security-qa
```

These commands validate manifest JSON structure, required fields, allowed roles, expected result values, labels, assertion shapes, required security-sensitive coverage, and risky static permission callback patterns. They cannot replace full E2E coverage because they do not bootstrap WordPress or compare the manifest to `wp_get_abilities()`.

For Docker Ability Contract QA, either start Compose yourself and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
composer qa:contract
docker compose down -v
```

For Docker Full MCP E2E QA, either start Compose yourself and run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
composer qa:e2e
docker compose down -v
```

Or let the Docker QA script manage Compose:

```bash
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:contract
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:e2e
```

Set `E2E_KEEP_COMPOSE=1` when you want to leave the containers running for debugging.

The E2E bootstrap installs Yoast SEO from WordPress.org with the `wordpress-seo` slug and SEOPress from WordPress.org with the `wp-seopress` slug because SEO abilities and assertions cover both providers. Set `YOAST_PLUGIN_SLUG` or `SEOPRESS_PLUGIN_SLUG` only when testing against a specific compatible package. It also installs `tests/e2e/site-kit-fixture.php` as a controlled must-use plugin so Site Kit route and response changes fail deterministically without requiring Google account credentials.

The runner fails early if either dependency is not active. Coexistence assertions seed SEOPress meta on a post that receives Yoast-backed updates and verify those Yoast paths do not mutate SEOPress meta; separate SEOPress assertions verify SEOPress-specific write and read paths.

Set `MCP_CRUD_ENDPOINT` only when you need the secondary CRUD runner to target a non-default MCP Adapter endpoint. By default it uses `http://localhost/wp-json/mcp/mcp-adapter-default-server` from inside the WordPress container.

PowerShell users can run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Contract
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -E2E
```

Unix, macOS, and Git Bash users can run:

```bash
scripts/qa-local.sh --contract
scripts/qa-local.sh --e2e
```

## PR comment coverage summary

The E2E PR comment includes:

- registered `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability count
- manifest-covered ability count
- manifest test case count
- negative permission case count

These counts make it visible when an enhancement adds new ability coverage.

Full E2E artifacts also include `mcp-crud-summary.json` for the secondary protocol-level CRUD QA phase.
