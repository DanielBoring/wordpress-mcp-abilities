# Plugin Changelog

Plugin-facing changes to Webmastery Site Toolkit for MCP are tracked here. Release notes and version sections should include only changes that affect plugin users, MCP tool compatibility, WordPress behavior, or packaged plugin functionality.

Repository, CI, contributor, and GitHub platform changes are tracked separately in `.github/REPOSITORY_CHANGELOG.md`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added read-only Google Site Kit compatibility abilities for setup and authentication status, module state, current-user permissions, and same-site PageSpeed summaries, with Site Kit-native permission enforcement and sensitive upstream fields removed.

## 2.5.0

### Added

- Added a readme.txt FAQ entry covering which AI clients and MCP hosts work with the plugin.

### Changed

- Updated the readme.txt short description and Description section to lead with the 70+ permission-aware ability count across 16 areas and to note supported MCP clients.

### Changed

- Hardened post, page, custom post type, media, and SEO score list abilities so returned items and totals only include objects the caller can access for the requested status, including private and trashed content.

- Restricted runtime environment details, WordPress version, and theme version to Administrator-capable users while keeping low-privilege site basics available.
- Removed author login fields from content responses and gated user login/email fields behind user-edit permissions.
- Required publish capabilities for private, scheduled, and published status changes and for bulk publishing.
- Replaced plugin activation/deactivation public permission callbacks with their real plugin-management permission checks while retaining execute-time checks.

## 2.4.0

- Added an Administrator-only plugin audit for inactive plugins, cached updates, tested-up-to compatibility, potential abandonment, local file age, and cached security-update flags without network calls.
