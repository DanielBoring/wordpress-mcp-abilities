# QA Strategy

This repository uses layered QA for a public WordPress.org plugin. The goal is to catch the cheapest problems first, then add WordPress runtime, MCP transport, security, compatibility, and release-package evidence when a change can affect users, site data, permissions, or publishing.

The plugin is now reviewed as a WordPress.org plugin, so QA must prove more than "the code runs." It must also prove ability permissions, object-level access, response privacy, WordPress compatibility, and package contents stay aligned with WordPress.org expectations.

## QA checks

| GitHub Actions check | Command | What it proves | When it should run |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 - Static QA | `composer qa:static` | PHP files parse, WordPress Coding Standards pass, PHPStan can analyze the plugin at the configured level, Composer dependencies have no known locked advisories, the E2E manifest is structurally valid, security-sensitive QA policy checks pass, and the diff has no whitespace errors. | Every PR and every push to `main`. |
| 2 - Unit Tests | `composer qa:unit` | Small pieces of PHP logic behave correctly without booting WordPress. These tests are the fast safety net for sanitization, response shape, permission helpers, SEO metadata normalization, taxonomy helpers, plugin safety logic, and failure paths. | Every PR and every push to `main`. |
| 3 - Ability Contract QA | `composer qa:contract` or `bash scripts/e2e-test.sh contract` | WordPress boots in Docker, required plugins load, every registered ability is represented in `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json`, manifest cases execute through `wp_get_ability()->execute()`, permission-sensitive cases pass, and the debug log stays clean. | Runtime PRs, ability PRs, security-sensitive PRs, `main`, releases, and manual dispatch. |
| 4 - Full MCP E2E QA | `composer qa:e2e` or `bash scripts/e2e-test.sh e2e` | A real MCP HTTP JSON-RPC session can discover and execute abilities through the MCP Adapter, including Application Password authentication, session setup, tool discovery, editor CRUD, and subscriber denial. | Runtime PRs, ability PRs, security-sensitive PRs, `main`, releases, and manual dispatch. |
| 5 - Release Package QA | `composer qa:release` or `bash scripts/release-qa.sh` | Release metadata is aligned, Ability Contract QA and Full MCP E2E QA pass, the release zip contains only packaged plugin files, and WordPress Plugin Check evaluates the built package instead of the development checkout. | Release PRs, tags, and manual dispatch. |
| 6 - Compatibility QA | `.github/workflows/compatibility-qa.yml` | Scheduled/manual Docker QA against the primary stack and a floating-latest PHP/WordPress image catches upstream drift in WordPress, PHP, MCP Adapter, Yoast SEO, SEOPress, and Plugin Check dependencies. | Weekly schedule, manual dispatch, release-candidate investigation, and upstream-breakage triage. |

## Security QA policy

Security QA is a cross-cutting gate, not just a separate scanner. The permission issue fixed in PR #90 showed that valid syntax, WPCS, and broad ability coverage are not enough unless the tests explicitly prove the permission model.

For every new or changed `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` ability, review whether it is security-sensitive. An ability is security-sensitive when it does any of the following:

- reads private, draft, pending, scheduled, trashed, user, environment, plugin, security, database, backup, or performance data
- returns full object payloads, totals, author identity, login names, emails, backend versions, filesystem/plugin details, or other fingerprinting data
- creates, updates, deletes, publishes, schedules, privates, restores, activates, deactivates, uploads, or otherwise changes site state
- accepts object IDs, URLs, HTML, metadata keys, taxonomy terms, plugin identifiers, statuses, or role/capability-sensitive inputs

Security-sensitive abilities must include:

1. A positive manifest case for a role/capability that should be allowed.
2. A negative manifest case for a role/capability that should be denied, unless the ability intentionally returns public-safe data and that rationale is documented.
3. Object/status-aware assertions for list/query abilities that can return mixed authorization results.
4. `assert_missing_paths` for sensitive fields that must not appear for lower-privilege callers.
5. Failure-path assertions for status escalation, protected metadata, unsafe URLs, ambiguous identifiers, stale preconditions, and destructive actions where applicable.

`composer validate:security-qa` enforces the current high-risk policy:

- `permission_callback => '__return_true'` is blocked in plugin ability registrations unless intentionally allow-listed in the validator after explicit security review.
- The permission-hardening regression cases from PR #90 must keep negative manifest coverage.
- Sensitive identity and fingerprinting absence assertions must remain in the manifest.

This validator is intentionally conservative. It should catch known dangerous patterns without replacing human review, WordPress.org review, or future deeper static analysis such as CodeQL or Semgrep.

## Ability Contract QA vs Full MCP E2E QA

These two checks both use Docker WordPress, but they prove different things.

Ability Contract QA is the plugin contract layer. It asks: "Inside WordPress, did this plugin register the abilities we expect, and do the manifest cases pass with the right permissions and response shapes?" It is broad and ability-driven.

Full MCP E2E QA is the real transport layer. It asks: "Can an MCP client actually talk to WordPress through the MCP Adapter and perform real work?" It is narrower but deeper, because it uses Application Passwords, MCP session initialization, `tools/list`, ability discovery, and real CRUD calls over HTTP JSON-RPC.

Both layers matter. Contract QA catches broad ability drift and permission regressions. Full MCP E2E catches transport and integration problems that direct PHP execution cannot see.

## Trigger matrix

| Event or change type | 1 - Static QA | 2 - Unit Tests | 3 - Ability Contract QA | 4 - Full MCP E2E QA | 5 - Release Package QA | 6 - Compatibility QA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Docs-only PR | Required | Required | Skipped unless manually dispatched | Skipped unless manually dispatched | Skipped | Skipped |
| Runtime PR | Required | Required | Required | Required | Skipped unless release-impacting | Manual when compatibility-risky |
| New or changed ability | Required | Required | Required | Required | Skipped unless release-impacting | Manual when dependency/version-risky |
| Security-sensitive PR | Required | Required | Required | Required | Required when release-bound | Manual before release when risk is broad |
| Push to `main` | Required | Required | Required when runtime files changed | Required when runtime files changed | Skipped | Scheduled/manual |
| Release PR | Required | Required | Required | Required | Required | Manual for release candidates |
| Tag `v*` | Covered by release workflow setup and prior PR checks | Covered by prior PR checks | Covered by Release Package QA | Covered by Release Package QA | Required | Covered by scheduled/manual release-candidate run |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Runs selected workflow | Runs selected workflow | Runs | Runs | Runs | Runs |
| Weekly schedule | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped | Skipped | Runs |

Runtime-impacting paths include plugin source, tests, scripts, Docker configuration, Composer files, workflow files, package metadata, assets, and `readme.txt`.

## Branch protection recommendation

Require these checks before merging any PR:

- `1 - Static QA`
- `2 - Unit Tests`

Require these checks before merging runtime-impacting, ability, or security-sensitive PRs:

- `3 - Ability Contract QA`
- `4 - Full MCP E2E QA`

Require release/package QA before publishing a release:

- `5 - Release Package QA`

Use `6 - Compatibility QA` as a scheduled/manual maintainer gate at first. Promote individual compatibility jobs to required only after they are stable and low-noise.

The important GitHub concept is "required status checks." A workflow can run on many events, but branch protection decides which successful checks are required before a PR can merge.

## Which command should I run?

For a docs-only change:

```bash
composer qa
```

For a normal code bugfix:

```bash
composer qa
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:contract
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:e2e
```

For a new or changed ability:

```bash
composer qa
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:contract
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:e2e
```

For a security-sensitive change:

```bash
composer qa
composer validate:security-qa
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:contract
E2E_MANAGE_COMPOSE=1 composer qa:e2e
```

For release preparation:

```bash
composer qa
composer qa:release
```

`composer qa:release` runs the Docker contract and transport checks before Plugin Check. If Docker is unavailable locally, use GitHub Actions for the authoritative release validation and document the local blocker in the PR.

PowerShell users can use the local wrapper:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Contract
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -E2E
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Release
```

Bash users can use the local wrapper:

```bash
scripts/qa-local.sh
scripts/qa-local.sh --contract
scripts/qa-local.sh --e2e
scripts/qa-local.sh --release
```

## WordPress.org release-readiness policy

Before publishing a WordPress.org-facing release:

1. Confirm version metadata matches across the plugin header, `readme.txt` stable tag, changelog, release notes, zip name, and tag.
2. Run `composer qa` and `composer qa:release`.
3. Confirm Plugin Check evaluates the built package under the canonical `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp` slug.
4. Confirm no unexpected WordPress debug-log warnings, notices, deprecations, or errors appear during Docker QA.
5. Confirm security-sensitive changes have manifest evidence for allowed and denied access.
6. Review the official [WordPress.org Detailed Plugin Guidelines](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/) for release-impacting changes, especially licensing, bundled assets, external services, tracking consent, executable remote code, readme content, default WordPress libraries, SVN discipline, version increments, and trademarks.
7. Run or review the latest `6 - Compatibility QA` result before uploading a release candidate to WordPress.org.
8. Document any known Plugin Check warnings, guideline considerations, or unavailable local tooling in the PR.

Plugin Check supports the guideline review, but it does not replace maintainer responsibility for the final WordPress.org package contents and behavior.

## Compatibility policy

The default PR path should stay stable and reasonably fast. Compatibility QA starts as scheduled/manual coverage because upstream images, plugin versions, and dependency repositories can change independently of a PR.

The current compatibility workflow runs:

- the primary Docker stack used by default QA
- a floating-latest WordPress image on a newer PHP runtime

When compatibility failures occur, triage them as:

- **release blocker** when the failure affects the supported primary stack or a supported WordPress/PHP combination
- **upstream drift** when a floating-latest dependency changed and the plugin needs an adjustment or documented compatibility boundary
- **workflow maintenance** when the failure is caused by runner/image/tooling changes unrelated to plugin behavior

## Environment notes

The QA layers are the same in every environment, but the safest entrypoint differs by shell.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is the authoritative validation gate before merge. The workflows install their own PHP and Composer runtime, use Ubuntu shell tools, and run Docker jobs on GitHub-hosted Linux runners.

Use branch protection to require the relevant workflow checks instead of relying only on a contributor's local machine.

### Windows PowerShell

PowerShell users should prefer the local wrapper because it checks prerequisites and gives Windows-specific hints:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Contract
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -E2E
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/qa-local.ps1 -Release
```

Docker Desktop must be running for Docker QA. Native `php`, `composer`, and archive tooling may depend on Windows PATH setup. When the native PHP/Composer path is not available, the project can still run many checks through Docker-based PHP/Composer commands.

### Windows Git Bash

Git Bash users should prefer login-shell style commands for Docker QA:

```bash
bash -lc './scripts/e2e-test.sh contract'
bash -lc './scripts/e2e-test.sh e2e'
bash -lc 'bash scripts/release-qa.sh'
```

The Docker runner sets `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` so Git Bash does not rewrite Linux container paths such as `/var/www/html/wp-load.php` into Windows paths. This matters because Docker commands in the runner execute inside Linux containers, even though the shell is running on Windows.

Depending on local PATH and Docker Desktop setup, `bash scripts/...` and `bash -lc './scripts/...'` can resolve Docker shims differently. If a plain Git Bash invocation fails locally but GitHub Actions passes, retry with the login-shell form above before assuming the repo script is broken.

### Local caveats

Docker Desktop must be running before Docker QA can start. WordPress, MCP Adapter, Yoast SEO, SEOPress, Plugin Check, and release package checks all depend on network access during fresh local runs.

Local Plugin Check output may include known warnings that are acceptable for this project. The release process should treat unexpected errors as blockers, while the documented warnings in `CONTRIBUTING.md` remain known review items.

## How to read failures

Static QA failures usually mean the code has a syntax, style, static-analysis, manifest-shape, security-policy, dependency-audit, or whitespace problem. Fix these first because they are the cheapest.

Unit test failures usually mean a small helper contract changed. Either fix the behavior or intentionally update the test if the contract changed.

Ability Contract QA failures usually mean the plugin and manifest disagree, a permission case is wrong, an ability response shape changed, an expected sensitive field appeared, or WordPress logged a problem.

Full MCP E2E failures usually mean the real MCP Adapter path broke: session setup, tool discovery, ability execution, WordPress side effects, denied-role behavior, or cleanup.

Release Package QA failures usually mean the package is not ready to ship: Docker contract/transport checks failed, version metadata is out of sync, release notes are missing, dev files leaked into the zip, or Plugin Check found a WordPress.org readiness issue.

Compatibility QA failures usually mean upstream WordPress, PHP, MySQL, MCP Adapter, Yoast SEO, SEOPress, Plugin Check, or GitHub runner behavior changed and needs maintainer triage.
