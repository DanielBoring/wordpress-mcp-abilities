# Security Strategy

This repository is a public WordPress.org plugin that exposes MCP abilities. Security strategy focuses on preventing unsafe access to WordPress data and site-changing actions, while QA strategy defines the checks that prove the policy.

## Security goals

1. Use the narrowest relevant WordPress capability for every ability.
2. Avoid exposing private content, trashed content, backend environment details, user identity fields, plugin details, or other sensitive data to lower-privilege users.
3. Prevent status escalation such as publishing, scheduling, or making content private without the required capability.
4. Keep ability `permission_callback` behavior aligned with execute-time checks.
5. Treat dependency, workflow, and release automation as part of the security boundary.

## Threat model

Primary risks for this plugin:

- authenticated low-privilege users invoking MCP abilities that reveal data they could not access in wp-admin
- broad list abilities leaking private/trash content or unauthorized totals
- write abilities bypassing object, publish, delete, plugin-management, or administrator capabilities
- sensitive response fields exposing logins, emails, version fingerprints, plugin state, or environment details
- unsafe URLs, uploads, protected metadata, or unvalidated identifiers crossing trust boundaries
- compromised workflow tokens, leaked secrets, or vulnerable dependencies affecting release integrity

## Ability permission policy

Every ability must have an explicit `permission_callback`. Public `__return_true` callbacks are blocked by `composer validate:security-qa` unless intentionally allow-listed after explicit review.

Use these defaults:

| Ability type | Permission expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Public-safe read-only data | `read`, with documentation explaining why the response is safe. |
| Object reads | Object-aware checks such as `read_post`, `edit_post`, or mapped CPT capabilities before returning full object payloads. |
| List/query abilities | Query-level capability plus per-object/status filtering before normalizing results and totals. |
| Writes and deletes | Object-specific `edit_*` / `delete_*` checks and status-specific publish/private/schedule checks. |
| Plugin, environment, database, backup, performance, security, or runtime details | Administrator-level capabilities such as `manage_options` or plugin-management capabilities. |
| User identity data | Restrict login/email fields to callers with user-management capabilities; use `assert_missing_paths` for lower-privilege cases. |

## Security-sensitive test policy

Security-sensitive abilities must have E2E manifest coverage showing both allowed and denied behavior. Add `assert_missing_paths` when a response should omit sensitive fields for lower-privilege users.

Current static enforcement:

- `composer validate:security-qa`
- `composer validate:e2e-manifest`
- `composer audit --locked`
- `composer phpcs`
- PHPStan at the configured project level

Current runtime enforcement:

- Ability Contract QA executes all manifest cases in WordPress.
- Full MCP E2E verifies real MCP Adapter authentication, discovery, execution, and subscriber denial.
- Docker QA fails when the WordPress debug log contains warnings, notices, deprecations, or errors.

## Dependency and supply-chain policy

- Composer dependencies are audited with `composer audit --locked`.
- Dependency changes should be reviewed carefully in PRs.
- Use GitHub Dependency Review or Dependabot features when available to prevent vulnerable dependencies from entering the repository.
- Release workflows should build from the reviewed repository state and validate package contents before publishing.

## Secrets and workflow security

- Do not commit credentials, Application Passwords, tokens, SVN passwords, or service keys.
- Prefer GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` with explicit job-level `permissions`.
- Do not expose secrets to workflows running untrusted PR code.
- Rotate any secret that appears in logs or repository history.
- Keep release credentials outside repository files. WordPress.org SVN deployment uses GitHub Actions secrets named `SVN_USERNAME` and `SVN_PASSWORD`; prefer storing them as protected `wordpress-org` environment secrets so they are only available after approval. Repository-level GitHub Secrets can work as a fallback, but the publish job must remain protected by the environment gate.

## WordPress.org guideline security and privacy expectations

The Detailed Plugin Guidelines make plugin developers responsible for all plugin contents and actions. For this MCP plugin, guideline review should be part of security review when a PR changes:

- **External communication** — document required third-party services in `readme.txt`; do not contact external servers for tracking or non-essential functionality without explicit consent.
- **Executable remote code** — do not load executable plugin, theme, update, JavaScript, or CSS code from third-party systems unless it is a documented service use that the guidelines allow.
- **Public credits and links** — do not add public-facing "powered by" links, credits, or promotional output unless it is opt-in and disabled by default.
- **Admin notices** — keep dashboard notices scoped, actionable, dismissible, and self-removing when resolved.
- **Bundled assets and libraries** — ensure included code/assets are GPL-compatible and use WordPress-provided libraries instead of duplicating default libraries.
- **Readme claims** — avoid unsupported security, compliance, legal, traffic, SEO, or automation guarantees in public-facing copy.

## Vulnerability response

1. Prefer private reporting for suspected exploitable vulnerabilities.
2. Triage severity, affected versions, exploitability, and whether WordPress.org users are exposed.
3. Fix on a private branch or security advisory fork when appropriate.
4. Add regression tests or manifest cases that would have caught the issue.
5. Release a patched version and publish advisory notes when needed.
6. If the vulnerability affects a released package, coordinate WordPress.org plugin update timing and user communication.
