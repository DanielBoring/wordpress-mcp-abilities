## Checklist
- [ ] Capability checks use the narrowest relevant WordPress capability and return/surface `WP_Error` on failure
- [ ] List/query abilities filter returned objects with object/status-aware checks and do not leak unauthorized totals or sensitive identity fields
- [ ] Security-sensitive abilities include allowed and denied E2E manifest cases, plus `assert_missing_paths` for fields hidden from lower-privilege callers
- [ ] Inputs are sanitized or validated (`sanitize_text_field`, `sanitize_key`, `absint`, `wp_kses_post`, enum validation, or an equivalent WordPress API)
- [ ] Ability responses follow the existing success/error shape for the affected ability group
- [ ] New ability names use the `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/` prefix and set accurate `annotations` (`readonly`, `destructive`, `idempotent`)
- [ ] If this PR adds or changes `webmastery-site-toolkit-for-mcp/*` abilities, `tests/e2e/abilities-manifest.json` includes matching positive and negative cases where permissions apply
- [ ] User-facing changes update relevant docs (`README.md`, `readme.txt`, `tests/e2e/README.md`, or other affected markdown)
- [ ] Plugin-facing changes update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`
- [ ] Repository, CI, contributor, GitHub platform, template, or agent workflow changes update `.github/REPOSITORY_CHANGELOG.md` under `## Unreleased`

- [ ] Compatibility QA was considered for release candidates, dependency-sensitive changes, or WordPress/PHP support changes
- [ ] CI/CD, security, or release process changes update the matching strategy document when policy changes
- [ ] Release-impacting changes account for GitHub tag `vX.Y.Z`, WordPress.org SVN tag `X.Y.Z`, protected `wordpress-org` deployment approval, and package/readme/version alignment
- [ ] WordPress.org Detailed Plugin Guidelines were considered for public-facing or release-impacting changes such as naming, readme text, privacy/external calls, licensing, bundled assets, and release packaging; see `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/security-strategy.md`, and `docs/release-strategy.md`
